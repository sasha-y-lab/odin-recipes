        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil for brushing</li>

        <li>2 large eggs</li>
            
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            
        <li>1 cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            
        <li>2 large eggplants, peeled and sliced into 1/2-inch rounds</li>
            
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            
        <li>48 ounces chunky tomato sauce</li>
            
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
                Grease 2 baking sheets and a 9x13-inch baking dish 
                with 1 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
            
            <li>Whisk together eggs and water in a shallow dish. 
                Combine Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, salt, and 
                pepper in a separate shallow dish.</li>

            <li>Dip eggplant slices into egg mixture, then press into 
                bread crumb mixture. Gently tap off any excess crumbs. 
                Arrange breaded eggplant slices on the prepared baking 
                sheets.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the bottoms are golden 
                brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Flip eggplant and continue 
                baking until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside.</li>

            <li>Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F 
                (200 degrees C).</li>

            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high 
                heat. Stir in ground beef; season with salt and pepper. 
                Cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, about 
                10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Stir tomato sauce into 
                ground beef; bring to a simmer, then set sauce aside.</li>

            <li>Place 1/3 of the eggplant slices on the bottom of the 
                prepared baking dish. Pour 1/3 of the meat sauce on top 
                of eggplant layer.</li>

            <li>Sprinkle 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese on top of 
                sauce layer. Repeat this step 2 more times, finishing 
                with a layer of mozzarella cheese.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and 
                sauce is bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes 
                before slicing.</li>

        </ol>
